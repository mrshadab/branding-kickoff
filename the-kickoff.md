> “A great design solution is just one part of the project process; delivering a great presentation is equally as important.”

This documents serves as some sort of a guideline for people who want to replicate the branding experience we did for our clients. This almost a fork and based form SideCar Studies Branding Delivery, customized to the modern needs of a Symph Visual Designer.

1. Explain Your Design Workflow Link

Whether it is a private client or an agency, when they hire you they are hiring your workflow as well.

**2\) Provide Your Client With A Creative Brief**

My main advice at this point of the design workflow is to ask a lot of questions. Don’t be afraid to ask about anything, even if it seems off-topic. In the first meeting with a client, I always open with: "I will ask a lot of questions. Some of them may seem to have nothing to do with our project or not be necessary for the designer to know. But all this information is crucial. It will help me create an identity that expresses who you are and tap into your customers’ emotions.”

**3. Know How To Deal With Creative Clients Link**

Did you ever experience a client sitting next to you while you work on their project? I did, luckily only two or three times in my career. \(Having more than five years of studio/agency experience, I can say that I’m a lucky person.\) These were our studio clients, so I wasn’t able to resist my boss and refuse to work in such close collaboration. And yes, when the clients left our office at the end of the day I got loud applause from the whole team. However, it was enough for me to set another rule for my creative process: do your best to engage clients in the process of brand creation. Make sure you understand each other. It also helps if you do all the corrections remotely.

How do we handle a situation when a creative client starts suggesting their ideas at the first meeting or while completing the brief? This situation makes a lot of designers roll their eyes, including me. But eventually I change my mind, knowing that collaboration with clients improves.

This doesn’t mean you should follow your client when they suggest, “Let’s do this.” Client ideas are a very valuable resource. It means they really care! And they want you to help.

That said, respect your client’s ideas. Listen to them carefully. Ask why they think it might be a good solution, even if you disagree. You should always assure them that you will take their idea into consideration and that you will work on it.

Normally clients won’t come up with an ultimate branding idea, but that’s no surprise: their job is to run a company, and yours is to brand it. What to do in this situation?

**Here are two tricks for you:**

Treat the client’s idea as a set of keywords and try to redesign it.

Even if you know that the client’s sketches neither match the brand’s goals nor appeal to the target audience, include these logos in the first presentation and explain to the client why you won’t take their concepts further: “I really like your idea, but it won’t work for your business. Here’s why…” Be prepared with some robust arguments.

The final advice I’d like to give here: you should be very careful with clients who already have made a sketch on their own or by another designer and want you to turn it into a logo. You need to define yourself: are you a professional who suggests design solutions, or a technician with Adobe Illustrator skills? “What a question! Of course, I’m a pro,” you say. So feel free to reply to the client honestly:

“If you just want just vectorize your sketch, hire a design student. They will do it well and it won’t cost you too much. But if you would like to hire me for this project, we will follow the complete logo design process. Of course, I will remember your sketch and will try to work on it. For now, without knowing all the project details, I cannot promise that it will be the best solution in your case and I will come up with other concepts.”

If your client agrees, your credibility as a designer is established. If not, then they were not the right client for you.
