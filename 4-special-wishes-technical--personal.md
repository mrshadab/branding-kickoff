### **Word Mark **

is a logo created entirely with text, usually the name of the company or brand, which is styled in a unique and memorable way. A great option for a new company or brand as the name is clearly stated.

### **Letterform Mark** 

logos are constructed from single letter or initials that are relevant to the brand. This is popular for somewhat established brands with some customer recognition.

### **Pictorial Mark**

embody general qualities, characteristics or values relevant to the brand. Sometimes these logos are not easily recognisable, but are useful to bring together several independent projects or divisions.
