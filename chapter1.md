# Defining Delivery

“We define “delivery” as the work sent to a client at the end of each production cycle, and the “deliverable” as that work in document format. ”

### What is a 'Good Delivery'

“..a good concept can only go so far without the proper visual presentation and storytelling”  
“..spend the extra time to build out an in-depth and story-driven presentation”
