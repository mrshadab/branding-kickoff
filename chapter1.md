# Design is a Job

I just want to quote Iryna Nezhynska on this:

>**We are not artists.** We donâ€™t express ourselves by designing things. _We are passionate about design, but for us design is not just a passion. And it is definitely not a hobby._

And that's perfectly okay, so don't take it in a negative way :)

So, always listen to the stakeholder's requirements, and in doing so, you are actually solving a problem. **Design thinking is problem solving through visual communication.**

Ultimately, the goal of design is help our clients businesses. And everything is actually designed, only some things are designed better.
