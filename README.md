# The Creative Brief
Welcome to our Branding Kickoff Meeting!

>“I will ask a lot of questions. Some of them may seem to have nothing to do with our project or not be necessary for the designer to know. But all this information is crucial. It will help me create an identity that expresses who you are and tap into your customers’ emotions.”

This is what the creative brief is all about.
