# Starting the Kickoff
Here are a couple of things you need to prepare for the kickoff:

### Pitch
Not everyone in the room may know about you, your work, or even your company. Skip all the ~~mission-vision bullcrap. lol~~. What you need to do show is who you are and what you are capable of. A brief intro of your company and the services you offer to your top clients is cool, flashing that killer portfolio is also rad. But what you need to explain carefully, is what value you're bringing to the table.

### Explain Your Design Workflow
Assuming that you've never worked before with the client, you need guide the stakeholders with your process - this way, as early in the beginning expectations are already set and no mismatched client expectations happen. (You don't want to go into the rabbit hole of endless client revisions) When they hire you, _they are hiring your workflow_  as well. 

You can refer to the **Branding Workflow Guide** here below. Feel free to modify it according to how you work best.
